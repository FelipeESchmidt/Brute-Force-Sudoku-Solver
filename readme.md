# Brute Force Sudoku Solver

Brute force algorithm to solve Sudoku game, and how it works?

## Algorithm 'Intelligence'

- Will go to the next empty position
- Will add first possible number
- If none possible number in the current position, it go back to last position and try next possible number
- It will loop it until Sudoku game is done

## Why Brute Force?

It was a college work :)

It's neither the best way nor faster way to solve but is a funny way to see it working
